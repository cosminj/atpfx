-- Disable triggers in order to avoid some interference 
-- between Hibernate and Oracle triggers when inserting
-- The <param name="sequence"> from *.hbm.xml gets an ID when Hibernate tries to save data
-- and if triggers are active, the sequence is called again by Oracle at insertion of row
-- and the ID got by Hibernate becomes obsolete and out of sync with the data in primary key
